object items are only listed for the last attribute.
Eg propertyMetadata is the object for many attributes per tab type.

No: 
If an object ref is only used once then the current sw is ok
But if more than once, add as a sub-statement inside parent.

Better: object ref and array of scalar should be inline for the parent.


3rd try
if object attribiute does not include an arrayOfObj item (recurse) then include as an attribute of parent.
include arrayOfScalar attribute as an attribute of parent

***
If exploring an attributeObject returns null then the object was previously explored.
So copy the prior obj def to the item

Why aren't propertyMetadata attributes showing in their parents
